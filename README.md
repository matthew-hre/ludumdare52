## theme: "Harvest"

A game about removing memories from a dead body to reconstruct a crime

- to remove or extract (something, such as living cells, tissues, or organs) from culture (see culture entry 1 sense 3) or from a living or recently deceased body especially for transplanting
- neo noir game, cyberpunk-ey
- you're a surgeon and need to solve a crime
  - dead politician, need to extract memories
  - police on scene, couple witnesses
- need to get key details from witnesses in order to gain access to memories
  - memories are "encrypted"
- memories are able to trigger _new_ memories in witnesses

### mechanics

- **interrogation**

  - line up of several witnesses, as well as a few cops
  - able to begin dialogue with each one, have series of questions you can ask
    - questions can be unlocked/restricted depending on choices
    - new questions can be unlocked based on new evidence

- **notebook**

  - keeps tracks of actual clues
    - are registered once discovered
  - also has a list of all people talked to
    - can select possible suspect
      - need 5 pieces of evidence to be able to confirm location/motive

- **memories**
  - able to insert pins into different areas of the brain / machinery
    - think phone switch board
  - data must be decrypted using a certain key word in a puzzle
    - rot13 style? replacement code? something simple probably.
  - incorrect codes give irrelevant information
  - performing too many injections can cause memory loss
    - some characters can be lost in memory stream
    - losing more that 35% of characters results in total memory loss
